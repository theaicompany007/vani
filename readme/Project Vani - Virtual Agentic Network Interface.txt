### Slide 1: Title & Introduction

# PROJECT VANI: STRATEGIC GO-TO-MARKET
## Agentic AI for Indian FMCG & General Trade Distribution

**Prepared For:** Rajvinder Singh & Jitenn Paull (The AI Company)
**Subject:** Vertical AI Go-To-Market Strategy
**Target Sector:** Indian FMCG & General Trade Distribution

---

### Slide 2: Executive Summary (The Thesis & Solution)

#### The Coverage Gap Thesis

*   FMCG distribution in India suffers from a massive **"Coverage Gap"**.
*   Human sales visits are too expensive (₹300/visit) for small orders.
*   Brands like Asian Paints and Coca-Cola miss out on **80% of potential retail outlets** due to this high cost.

#### The Solution: Project Vani

*   **Project Vani (Virtual Agent Network Interface)** is an **Agentic AI Sales Platform** developed by **The AI Company**.
*   It automates outbound ordering for the unserved **"Long Tail"** of retailers.
*   **The Positioning:** The AI Company is the full-stack platform provider, delivering the **"Digital Sales Workforce" as a service**.

### Slide 3: The Market Opportunity (The "Kill Shot")

#### The Coverage Paradox

| Metric | Detail | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Universe** | ~12-13 million Retail Outlets (Kirana, Paan, Hardware, Medical) in India. | |
| **Direct Coverage** | Top brands only reach the top 20-30% (approx. 2-3M stores) directly. | |
| **The Void** | **8-10 million stores** are left to wholesalers. The brand loses data, control, and revenue visibility in this segment. | |

#### Why Traditional Digital Solutions Failed

*   **Small retailers (the bottom 80%) are often time-starved or tech-averse**.
*   They do not download or effectively use e-B2B apps (Shikhar, Bees, etc.).
*   **They prefer voice interaction**.

### Slide 4: The Arbitrage: Human vs. Vani (The AI Company)

The **Agentic AI Platform** (Vani) uses proprietary **"Sales Ontology"** trained on millions of Indian trade conversations. It uses infrastructure-agnostic telecom integration for zero-latency voice to replace human field agents.

| Metric | Human Salesman | App Notification | Vani (The AI Company) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | **₹300 / Visit** | ₹0.10 / Msg | **₹5 - ₹10 / Call** |
| **Reach** | 30 stores/day | Unlimited | **Unlimited** |
| **Interaction** | High Touch | Zero Touch | **High Touch (Voice)** |
| **Literacy Req** | None | High | **None** |

### Slide 5: Commercial Models (Pricing Strategy Overview)

**Recommendation:** Use Option A for the Pilot ("The Trojan Horse") and migrate to Option C for the annual contract.

#### Option A: The "Lazarus" Model (Pure Outcome)
*   **Concept:** "We only get paid if we wake up a dead store."
*   **Target Segment:** Inactive Retailers (No order in >90 days).
*   **Pricing:**
    *   Setup Fee: ₹0 (Waived for Pilot).
    *   Success Fee: **₹100 - ₹150 per reactivated order**.
*   **Why it works:** Zero risk for the client; the Sales Director sees this as "found money" because they have unlimited budget for revenue generation.

#### Option C: The Hybrid Scale Model (Base + Upside)
*   **Concept:** "Cover costs, share the wins."
*   **Target Segment:** The entire "Long Tail" distribution network.
*   **Pricing:**
    *   Platform Fee: **₹10 per successful call connected** (Covers telecom/compute).
    *   Commission: **1% - 2% of Order Value generated**.
*   **Why it works:** **Aligns incentives**; if Vani upsells a new SKU, The AI Company shares in that growth, creating massive "Hockey Stick" revenue potential.

### Slide 6: Commercial Model - Option B (Pure SaaS)

#### Option B: The "Digital Seat" Model
*   **Concept:** "Hire Vani just like you hire a Salesman, but cheaper."
*   **Target Segment:** Low-value active stores (ordering <₹2k/month).
*   **Pricing:**
    *   Seat License: **₹5,000 per month per Digital Agent**.

| Comparison | Human Salesman | Digital Agent (Vani) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monthly Cost** | ~₹25,000 | **₹5,000** | |
| **Coverage** | ~300 stores | **~5,000 unique stores** | |
| **Equivalent Staff** | 1 Human Salesman | **Covers capacity of 10 human salesmen** | |

*   **Why it works:** This structure fits into standard IT/SaaS procurement budgets and offers high predictability (ARR) for investors.

### Slide 7: The Pilot Strategy: "The Lazarus Project"

#### Objective
*   **Do not try to replace the human fleet immediately**.
*   Prove value by targeting "Dead" or "Inactive" stores.

#### The Customer Pitch
*   "Give us 5,000 stores that haven't ordered in 90 days."
*   "We will deploy Vani to call them, negotiate in Hindi/Regional dialects, and reactivate them."
*   "You pay only for successful orders." (Option A: Lazarus Model)

#### The Wedge
Once The AI Company proves that Vani can generate revenue from "dead" stores, the project will expand to "low value" stores. This expansion effectively allows the platform to take over the bottom 80% of the client's distribution network.

### Slide 8: Target "Hit List" & Strategic Angles

| Target FMCG | Decision Maker | The Pain Point | The Angle (Vani) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hindustan Unilever (HUL)** | Arun Neelakantan | Need to drive "Shikhar" app usage in deep rural areas where literacy is a barrier. | Vani drives the bottom tier who prefer voice/can’t type, complementing Shikhar. | |
| **Britannia Industries** | Shantanu Gupta | High RTM costs (₹300/visit) make serving deep rural belts unviable. | Autonomous Voice AI costs pennies per call, covering 'dark' rural territories daily without adding headcount. | |
| **Marico** | Vaibhav Bhanchawat | Aggressive expansion into Pharmacies and Cosmetic Stores where the current human salesforce is weak. | Deploy Digital Agents to call 10,000 pharmacies in a day; avoids hiring a massive new field force. | |
| **ITC Limited (Foods)** | Hemant Malik | Human agents rush visits, causing retailers to forget to order half the SKUs in a massive portfolio. | Vani never forgets to upsell specific SKUs (like Bingo or new launches) based on purchase history on every call. | |

### Slide 9: Next Steps for Execution

#### 1. Platform Validation (Internal)

*   **Action:** Ensure our "Hinglish" sales model (e.g., "Do peti bhejo") is demo-ready for the specific FMCG context.
*   **Deliverable:** Finalize the "Sales Ontology" demo script by \[Date/Time Placeholder].

#### 2. Outreach (Trojan Horse Strategy)

*   Send tailored LinkedIn messages to the "Hit List" targets.
*   **Focus:** Center scripts on the specific pain points and pilot offer (The Lazarus Project).
    *   *Example to HUL:* Focus on solving the "Coverage Gap" for the bottom 50% who struggle with apps like Shikhar.
    *   *Example to Britannia:* Focus on RTM efficiency and replacing the high cost of the ₹300 human visit with an autonomous AI agent.

***

**Analogy for Understanding the Arbitrage:**

The Agentic AI Platform acts like an automated drone fleet capable of delivering highly personalized messages to every mailbox in a vast region, whereas the current system relies on expensive, individual couriers (human salesmen) who can only afford to visit the most profitable main street addresses. Vani captures revenue from the hard-to-reach rural routes that were previously deemed too costly to serve.
